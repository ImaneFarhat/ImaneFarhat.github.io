I am currently a third year student at Ecole Polytechnique majoring in Applied Mathematics. You can find my CV [here](ImaneFarhat.github.io/CV Imane Farhat.pdf) (Last updated October 1st 2019). 

## Research projects
* **On multi-currency arbitrage on FX options and calibration of a Wishart model**
_Advisor : [Peter Tankov] (https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/tankov/) (Report to be uploaded soon).

* **Simulation of rare events**
_Advisors : [Emmanuel Gobet] (http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gobet/) and [Stefano de Marco] (http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~demarco/)
[Report] (ImaneFarhat.github.io/Modal___Report.pdf)
- Worked on the insolvency cascades in a network of financial institutions. 
- Assessed contagion and systemic risk in this network using Monte Carlo stochastic simulations. 
- Used different techniques to simulate rare events (of very low-probability) such as the default of all banks in the network.
