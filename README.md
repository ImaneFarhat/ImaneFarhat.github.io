# Imane Farhat
I am currently a Graduate student at MIT majoring in Data Science and Analytics. You can find my CV [here](ImaneFarhat.github.io/Imane Farhat v8.pdf) (Last updated October 1st 2020). 

## Research projects

* **Exploring the use of AI techniques for intelligent anomaly detection in data and its application to risk management**
_Advisors: [Marcos Carreira](https://quantreg.com/people/marcos-carreira/) and [Mathieu Rosenbaum](http://www.crest.fr/ses.php?user=3046)_
([Report](ImaneFarhat.github.io/PSC___Final_Report.pdf))
  - Worked on the use of AI for trade anomaly detection. 
  - Explored the use of supervised and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection in counterparty exposure profiles.
  - Detected structural changes in P&L of a derivatives portfolio. 

* **Simulation of rare events**
_Advisors: [Emmanuel Gobet](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gobet/) and [Stefano de Marco](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~demarco/)_
([Report](ImaneFarhat.github.io/Modal___Report.pdf))
  - Worked on the insolvency cascades in a network of financial institutions. 
  - Assessed contagion and systemic risk in this network using Monte Carlo stochastic simulations. 
  - Used different techniques to simulate rare events (of very low-probability) such as the default of all banks in the network. 

* **Statistical modeling of financial data**
_Advisor: [Mathieu Rosenbaum](http://www.crest.fr/ses.php?user=3046) ([Report](ImaneFarhat.github.io/MAP565_Project.pdf))._
  - Applied a statistical analysis to a financial dataset of Bitcoin prices.
  - Explored time series analysis with ARIMA and GARCH models.
  - Studied the modeling of the volatility clustering effect with Poisson processes and Hawkes processes.
  
* **On multi-currency arbitrage on FX options and calibration of a Wishart model**
_Advisor: [Peter Tankov](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/tankov/) ([Report](ImaneFarhat.github.io/P3A___Rapport_Final.pdf))._
  - Explored a model-free approach to detect arbitrage opportunities on FX options related to a triangle of exchange rates, for example options on the rates USD/EUR, JPY/EUR and JPY/USD. 
  - Calibrating the Wishart model for a triangle of exchange rates. 
  
## Course projects

* **Stochastic Calculus applied to finance - Computer Problem Sets**
