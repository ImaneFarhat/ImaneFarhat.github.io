# Imane Farhat
I am currently a third year student at Ecole Polytechnique majoring in Applied Mathematics. You can find my CV [here](ImaneFarhat.github.io/CV Imane Farhat.pdf) (Last updated October 1st 2019). 

## Research projects
* **On multi-currency arbitrage on FX options and calibration of a Wishart model**
_Advisor : [Peter Tankov](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/tankov/) ([Report] ImaneFarhat.github.io/P3A___Rapport_intermediaire.pdf))._
  - Explored a model-free approach to detect arbitrage opportunities on FX options related to a triangle of exchange rates, for example options on the rates USD/EUR, JPY/EUR and JPY/USD. 
  - Calibrating the Wishart model for a triangle of exchange rates. 

* **Simulation of rare events**
_Advisors : [Emmanuel Gobet](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gobet/) and [Stefano de Marco](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~demarco/)_
([Report](ImaneFarhat.github.io/Modal___Report.pdf))
  - Worked on the insolvency cascades in a network of financial institutions. 
  - Assessed contagion and systemic risk in this network using Monte Carlo stochastic simulations. 
  - Used different techniques to simulate rare events (of very low-probability) such as the default of all banks in the network. 
  
* **Exploring the use of AI techniques for intelligent anomaly detection in data and its application to risk management**
_Advisors : [Marcos Carreira](https://quantreg.com/people/marcos-carreira/)_
([Report](ImaneFarhat.github.io/PSC___Final_Report.pdf))
  - Worked on the use of AI for trade anomaly detection. 
  - Explored the use of supervised and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection in counterparty exposure profiles.
  - Detected structural changes in P&L of a derivatives portfolio.
